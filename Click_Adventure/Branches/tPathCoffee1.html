<h1> You have choosen to choose the Terminator Coffee Path
    </h1>
    <span> <p> You've choose to become the intern of the group and is now going out to the middle of the forest, where somehow, in this completely deserted abandoned place, a random old man hands you coffee, that seems quite questionable, to bring back to the group. You have your Bairpod Pros which allow incredible noise canceling (because of Bapple's supremely expensive technology) and taking one out will inevitably allow you to hear two different things... Do you take out your left Bairpod or right Bairpod.</p> </span>
